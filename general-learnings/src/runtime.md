# What is runtime? 

When executing a program the runtime is a programs life cycle. Runtimes are also part of the programming language and don't need to be install separately.  

## What are the key concepts of runtime? 

- **Execution**: Running the program code.

- **Runtime Environment**: The context in which the program runs.

- **Runtime Errors**: Errors occurring during program execution.

- **Memory Management**: Handling memory allocation and deallocation.

# What Happens During Runtime?
So, let’s kick things off. Imagine you’ve just compiled your program. What you get is a bundle of machine code, typically in the form of an executable file with a .exe extension. This is where our journey into the runtime environment begins—whether it's the start of your latest game or the activation of a server.

The first big task for the runtime environment is to handle memory management. This means figuring out how much memory is needed for variables, data structures, and objects, and then allocating and deallocating this memory as necessary. This is often managed by something called garbage collection, which keeps things running smoothly by cleaning up memory that’s no longer in use.

But that's not all. Event handling is another crucial part of runtime. It manages everything from user inputs like mouse clicks and keyboard presses to system signals. This ensures that your program responds to interactions in real-time. And let’s not forget about libraries and frameworks. These are additional pieces of code that provide extra functionality, making it easier to handle tasks like network requests or managing graphics. They extend the capabilities of your program without having to reinvent the wheel.
