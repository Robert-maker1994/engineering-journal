# What is runtime? 

When executing a program the runtime is a programs life cycle. Runtimes are also part of the programming language and don't need to be install separately.  

## What are the key concepts of runtime? 

- **Execution**: Running the program code.

- **Runtime Environment**: The context in which the program runs.

- **Runtime Errors**: Errors occurring during program execution.

- **Memory Management**: Handling memory allocation and deallocation.

## What are the pros and cons? 

Every runtime is different, for an easy comparison. Speed, if you want you're runtime to build and run quickly then you may want to use bun instead of node.js for you're epic typescript hello world app.
