## Katas-old collection.
This is a collection of katas I have created in the past to improve my skills as a software engineer. A lot of the katas here are organized by Topics. To learn more venture into the topic. This is in the old format where I wasn't logging the Solution and a little bit in development. 


To see the documentation run.
    `cargo doc --open`
