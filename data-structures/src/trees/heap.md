# Heap (Data Structure)

The heap data structure is a Tree based data structure which hold it's values from smallest to biggest. This is different from the **The stack and the heap** in programming languages which the heap here refers to memory allocation. Were as the DS is about a min heap and max heap organizing data. For example google uses Heap data structures for calculating the shortest route on google maps. 

## Terminology

- **Min Heap**: In a Min Heap, the value of each parent node is less than or equal to the values of its children. The smallest element is at the root.
- **Max Heap**: In a Max Heap, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The largest element is at the root.

For rust there is good documentation in the language docs [Binary Heap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BinaryHeap.html)
